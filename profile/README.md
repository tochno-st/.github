There are many prejudices and misinformation about Russia, which can only be dispelled with the help of solid data. The government is making open data less and less accessible, so we have to find alternative solutions.  

[**To Be Precise**](https://tochno.st/) is an independent media and think-tank, where we collect, clean, and upload data sets and data-driven research about social problems in Russia â€” from HIV and homelessness to gender inequality and air pollution. This data can be used for both scholarly analysis and data-storytelling. We think that social data science is one of the most effective tool in understanding and solving social problems, as well as combatting misinformation.

In this repository you can find our data projects and data. Feel free to collaborate!

The overall goal of the project is to facilitate access to official statistics and promote a data-driven approach to public discussion about Russia.
