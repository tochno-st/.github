There are many prejudices and misinformation about Russia, which can only be dispelled with the help of solid data. The government is making open data less and less accessible, so we have to find alternative solutions.  

[**To Be Precise**](https://tochno.st/) is an independent media and think-tank, where we collect, clean, and upload data sets and data-driven research about social problems in Russia â€” from HIV and homelessness to gender inequality and air pollution. This data can be used for both scholarly analysis and data-storytelling. We think that social data science is one of the most effective tool in understanding and solving social problems, as well as combatting misinformation.

What makes us unique compared to other media projects and those working with data is that we not only tell human stories, but also serve as a data catalog where we  provide statistical information in a user-friendly format. Besides this, we pay special attention to the regional dimension of the data to show that the picture in Russian regions is more complex and diverse than many people tend to think.

The overall goal of the project is to facilitate access to official statistics and promote a data-driven approach to public discussion about Russia.
