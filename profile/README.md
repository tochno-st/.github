There are many prejudices and misinformation about Russia, which can only be dispelled with the help of solid data. The government is making open data less and less accessible, so we have to find alternative solutions.  

**To Be Precise** is an independent media and think-tank, where we collect, clean, and upload data sets and data-driven research about social problems in Russia â€” from HIV and homelessness to gender inequality and air pollution.

Just another way to enable more than one language in our README.md files.
